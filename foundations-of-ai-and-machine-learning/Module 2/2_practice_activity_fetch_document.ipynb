This is a common requirement when dealing with web scraping, as many useful data sources are available in downloadable documents. You will learn how to identify and download documents using the web scraper you built.\n",

        "Start by selecting a website that offers downloadable reports, research papers, or datasets. Look for sections labeled \"Downloads,\" \"Reports,\" or \"Resources.\" Before you can download a document, you need to identify its location on the webpage. Typically, documents are linked via <a> (anchor) tags, which you can locate by inspecting the webpage's HTML structure. Right-click a document link and select Inspect to view its HTML. Identify an <a> tag with an href attribute containing .pdf, .txt, or another document format. If the link is relative (e.g., /files/report.pdf), combine it with the base website URL to form a full URL before using it in your scraper.\n",
